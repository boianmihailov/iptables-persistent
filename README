# Based on Debian's iptables-persistent package that simply starts the rules using an /etc/iptables/rules file.
# This one is bit modified to save rules at stop and display status.
#
# Also config file added to put in /etc/defaults/

# To use copy iptables-persistent in /etc/init.d/ and default_conf-iptables-persistent to /etc/defaults/iptables-persistent
